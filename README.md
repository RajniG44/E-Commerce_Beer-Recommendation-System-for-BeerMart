Beer Recommendation Strategies
Project Overview
The Beer Recommendation Strategies project focuses on developing a recommendation system that suggests beers to users based on their preferences and past behavior. This system uses various recommendation techniques, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models, to deliver personalized beer recommendations.

Introduction
This project aims to create an intelligent beer recommendation system that helps users discover new beers they are likely to enjoy. By analyzing user preferences, beer characteristics, and historical data, the system can provide recommendations based on factors such as beer type, flavor profile, and user reviews.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about various beers, including:

Beer name
Type of beer (e.g., IPA, lager, stout)
Alcohol by volume (ABV)
IBU (International Bitterness Units)
User ratings and reviews
Brewer details
Beer description
The dataset is sourced from public beer-related databases (e.g., RateBeer, BeerAdvocate).

Tech Stack
The following technologies were used in this project:

Python for data processing, modeling, and visualization
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
Scikit-learn for building machine learning models
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
Surprise library for collaborative filtering
Flask (if applicable for web deployment)
Methodology
The recommendation system is built using the following strategies:

Collaborative Filtering: This technique analyzes the behavior of users to recommend beers that similar users have enjoyed.
Content-Based Filtering: The system suggests beers based on beer attributes such as type, ABV, and IBU.
Hybrid Model: A combination of collaborative and content-based approaches to improve recommendation accuracy.
The models are evaluated using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and precision/recall.

Usage
To run the recommendation system, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/beer-recommendation-strategies.git
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Load the dataset and train the models:
bash
Copy
Edit
python train_models.py
Use the recommendation system:
bash
Copy
Edit
python recommend_beers.py --user_id 12345
Optionally, deploy the system using Flask for web-based interactions.
Results
The recommendation models are evaluated based on their ability to accurately predict beers that users would like, based on their historical preferences. A detailed analysis of the results is provided in the results directory, which includes evaluation metrics, graphs, and insights.
